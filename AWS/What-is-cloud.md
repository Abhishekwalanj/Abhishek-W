## Q1  What is cloud?
- Cloud computing operates on a similar principle as web-based email clients, 
  allowing users to access all of the features and files of the system without having to keep
  the bulk of that system on their own computers
- Most people already use a variety of cloud computing services without even realizing it. 
  Gmail, Google Drive and even Facebook and Instagram are all cloud-based applications,
  For all of these services, users are sending their personal data to a cloud-hosted server that stores the information
  for later access
- Compute resources as rent(pay as you go)
- Cloud computing is an internet-based computing service in which large groups of remote servers are networked to allow centralized data
  storage, and online access to computer services or resources.
- Using cloud computing, organizations can use shared computing and storage resources rather than building, operating, and
  improving infrastructure on their own.these services can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of servers in minutes and
  deliver results faster. We pay only for what we use with no up-front expenses and no long-term commitments, which makes AWS
  cost efficient.

## Q2 Advantages of cloud?
- Cloud computing is a model that enables the following features.
- Users can have provision and release resources on-demand.
- Resources can be scaled up or down automatically, depending on the traffic of the network.
- Resources are accessible over a network with proper security.
- Speed of the computing has become very fast.
- Cloud service providers can enable a pay-as-you-go model, where customers are charged based on the type of resources and per usage.
  
- Here is a list of some of the most important advantages that Cloud Computing has to offer -

**24 X 7 Availability**
  Most of the cloud providers are truly reliable in offering their services, with most of them maintaining an uptime of 99.9%. 
  The workers can get onto the applications needed basically from anywhere. Some of the applications even function off-line.
  
**Automatic Software Updates**
For those who have a lot to get done, there isn't anything more irritating than having to wait for system updates to be installed.

**Cost-Efficient**
Building our own servers and tools is time-consuming as well as expensive as we need to order, pay for,install,
 and configure expensive hardware, long before we need it. 
 However, using cloud computing, we only pay for the amount we use and when we use the computing resources. 
 In this manner, cloud computing is cost efficient.

**Reliability**
A cloud computing platform provides much more managed, reliable and consistent service than an in-house IT infrastructure.
 It guarantees 24x7 and 365 days of service. If any of the server fails,
 then hosted applications and services can easily be transited to any of the available servers.

**Unlimited Storage**
Cloud computing provides almost unlimited storage capacity, i.e., we need not worry about running out of
storage space or increasing our current storage space availability. We can access as much or as little as we need.

**Backup & Recovery**
Storing data in the cloud, backing it up and restoring the same is relatively easier than storing it on a physical device. 
The cloud service providers also have enough technology to recover our data, so there is the convenience of recovering our data anytime.

**Easy Access to Information**
Once you register yourself in cloud, you can access your account from anywhere in the worldprovided there is internet connection at that point. 
There are various storage and security facilities that vary with the account type chosen.
